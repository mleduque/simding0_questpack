  <h4><a id="Section1">Introduction</a></h4>
  <p>
    The Quest Pack contains a number of components designed to add
    additional adventures throughout Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn
    and Throne of Bhaal. While the expansion is supported by some
    material, it is not required. ToB-specific components will be
    automatically skipped if ToB is not detected. Some components may
    expand on existing quests, while others may be completely new. All
    are independent, optional to install, and do not rely on one
    another technically or in terms of story. Quest Pack
    uses <a href="http://www.weidu.org/">WeiDU</a> for ease of
    (un)installation, and compatibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    In expanding Baldur's Gate II to make the game more fulfilling,
    Quest Pack seeks to merge seamlessly with the content of the
    original game. When players claim that mods can never match the
    quality of a professional game, I consider it a challenge, and I
    can only hope that I've succeeded. Quest Pack contains dozens of
    interjections for both Bioware and mod NPCs; it will also interact
    fully with various other mods,
    including <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/kelsey">Kelsey</a>,
    <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/keto">Keto</a>
    and <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/virtue">Virtue</a>, all
    three of which will add to the BG2 and Quest Pack experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Quest Pack should not upset the balance of the game. It is no
    secret that, in the past, many quest mods have been the subject of
    complaints about overpowered items, excessive XP rewards, and so
    on. This should not be the case here, and if you do encounter any
    balancing issues, please feel free to raise them on the forum.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many of the battles in QP respond to the difficulty slider. If you
    find one too difficult, try reducing the setting. There should be
    no extreme Tactics-type combat in the mod, but it seeks to be
    challenging where appropriate.
  </p>

    the <a href="http://forums.pocketplane.net/index.php?board=21.0">forum</a>.

  <h4><a id="Section2">Components</a></h4>
  <h5>General AI Improvements & Expanded Vocabulary</h5>
  <p>
    This component is divided into two options: AI Improvements &
    Expanded Vocabulary, and AI Improvements Only. The AI changes are
    discussed below. If you choose the install the former option,
    creatures will also display a greater diversity of comments above
    their heads during battles, depending on their race, class and
    personality, rather than all humanoids unfailingly repeating "I
    can't take this!"
  </p>
  <p>
    With this component installed, creatures throughout the game will
    behave marginally more intelligently. Don't expect drastic
    increases in difficulty, but do expect, for example, creatures to
    no longer stand around without attacking inbetween drinking
    potions. This is not a tougher battles mod, but more of a fix for
    poor intelligence I witnessed while playing the game. Installing
    this should improve the overall Quest Pack experience, and indeed
    that of the game as a whole.
  </p>
  <p>
    If this component is installed, you get:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Less predictable attack targeting.</li>
    <li>Smarter usage of items such as potions and wands.</li>
    <li>Intelligent druid spellcasting.</li>
    <li>Intelligent paladin spellcasting.</li>
    <li>Randomised usage of certain abilities, such as Demilich
    imprisonment.</li>
    <li>New behaviour of illusionary images. (Simulacrum, Projected
    Image, Mislead.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You do not, however, get any changes to creature abilities. Stats,
    items, abilities, and so on remain unchanged. You also get legal
    AI&mdash;the scripts do not allow creatures to "cheat".
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that Demiliches may become substantially tougher with this
    component, as it is more difficult to "cheese" them. (I stress
    once again that they gain no new abilities save a bugfix to the
    Watcher's Keep Demilich's Spell Trigger, which previously failed
    to do anything except display text due to a coding error.) See the
    FAQ section if you're really finding them painful to endure with
    the new AI.
  </p>

  <h5>Creature & Area Improvements</h5>
  <p>
    This component is split into three parts: All Creature & Area
    Improvements, All Creature Improvements, and Boss Improvements
    Only. All seek to improve the atmosphere in BG2&mdash;be it by
    enhancing enemy environments, abilities or intelligence. The first
    option will install improvements to general creatures and bosses,
    and will make various changes to the environments in which you
    will encounter these creatures. The second option will install
    improvements to general creatures and to bosses, but omit changes
    to the areas themselves. The final option will only install the
    changes to bosses.
  </p>

  <p>
    The area changes are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The beholder lair in the Underdark responds to difficulty,
    with changes to beholder placement and creature addition as a
    result.</li>
    <li>The arbitrary summoning mish-mash on the bottom floor of the
    Guarded Compound is replaced by a more appropriate encounter.</li>
    <li>The lair of the Twisted Rune is better protected, and its
    guardians behave more sensibly.</li>
    <li>An array of ambushes may now take place in the North
    Forest.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The general creature changes are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Drow now gain innate abilities: Faerie Fire, Globe of
    Darkness, Dancing Lights. (Created by Kensai Ryu&mdash;this
    component also appears in D0Tweak.)</li>
    <li>Vampire abilities are standardised, so they will all use
    Domination and Fear to a degree suitable to their
    experience. Their intelligence is also vastly overhauled, allowing
    them to adapt to immunities. Additionally, vampires turning to bat
    form now grant 75% of their XP value.</li>
    <li>Mind Flayers gain a greater repertoire of psionic abilities,
    and will use them less predictably. They may also try to escape a
    battle if wounded (inspired by Blucher's Smarter Mind Flayers),
    and may even return to fight you again later. Alhoons also gain a
    small number of appropriate mage spells.</li>
    <li>Beholder abilities for all types are adjusted: they now use
    them less predictably. Additionally, it is possible to disable
    Beholders by destroying their eyestalks if you do enough
    damage. Finally, all beholder types are appropriately
    colour-coded. (The colour changes were inspired by Xyx's Smarter
    Beholders, which are, in fact, much smarter than Quest Pack's, but
    not for the faint of heart!)</li>
    <li>Umber Hulks use their gaze less predictably, and a distinction
    is made between the abilities of normal Umber Hulks and
    Elders.</li>
    <li>Mummies gain a "Gaze of Despair", as per PnP. It causes a
    Hopelessness effect which stuns all creatures in the area of
    effect for 3 rounds unless they save vs. spell.</li>
    <li>Salamanders regain their auras from IWD&mdash;these act
    similarly to fireshields corresponding to the Salamander
    type.</li>
    <li>Elite Fire Giants gain the ability to Berserk, as per their
    assigned class.</li>
    <li>Single-target gaze attacks now use a standard gaze projectile
    and can be identified by name.</li>
    <li>In the random encounter with slavers and orogs, the former now
    have something to launch their +1 arrows from.</li>
    <li>The XP value of Sendai's Derro horde is reduced to something
    more sane. (Originally the slaves were worth an excessive 12000 XP
    each.)</li>
    <li>Shadows fizzle away when killed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The boss changes seek to make Irenicus and Bodhi more
    credible. All incarnations of them are affected. While these
    changes made mainly affect AI, some new abilities are also
    granted. Bodhi may now Dominate in the same way as other vampires,
    and she also gains the ability to Control Undead. Irenicus in
    Suldanessellar now has a greater repertoire of low-level spells,
    and gains the ability to Dimension Door to you if you flee the
    battle. Additionally, on Hard difficulty, Tree of Life Irenicus
    gains one use of Improved Alacrity, and on Insane, Tree of Life
    Irenicus gains two and Spellhold Irenicus gains one.
  </p>

  <p>
    This component will automatically install Detectable Spells.
  </p>

  <h5>Miscellaneous Enhancements</h5>
  <p>
    This component does not add a single new quest per se, but instead
    introduces assorted new minor encounters and enhancements in
    various places during the game, to spice up the atmosphere.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the encounters may be recognisable from Iron Modder
    competitions; however, all have been fixed and improved in some
    way. This component may safely be installed over the top of Iron
    Modder entries, but not vice versa.
  </p>
  <p>
    The complete list of changes introduced by this component is as
    follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A new encounter now takes place in the graveyard in chapter
    6. (Bons IM.)</li>
    <li>There is a sinister new encounter with a spectre in the
    Saradush prison. (Bons IM.)</li>
    <li>You can visit a new character in the Umar Hills Inn to hear a
    sinister tale once you exit the Underdark. (Blue IM.)</li>
    <li>Madulf will help protect Imnesvale during the paladin
    stronghold quest set there.</li>
    <li>The lost girl in the Docks District can now be reunited with
    her mother.</li>
    <li>New possibilities are introduced for dealing with the orphaned
    child in Saradush.</li>
    <li>Sime now has a proper fate, providing closure where none was
    present originally. (Previously she would go for help and never be
    mentioned again.)</li>
    <li>OPTIONAL: New random encounters are introduced, both in the
    city and in the wilderness. (This will work alongside the similar
    component in the Tactics mod.)</li>
    <li>There is now a minor followup to the discovery of the lich in
    the Crooked Crane.</li>
    <li>In the Windspear Hills, the Knights' illusion may be
    dispelled.</li>
    <li>The Trademeet Rakshasas now respond to the Flail of the
    Ages.</li>
    <li>Resurrecting Mummies works more frequently and provides more
    diverse dialogue.</li>
    <li>A dog will befriend you temporarily in the Docks.</li>
    <li>The infamous Battle Horror makes a reappearance. Be
    prepared.</li>
    <li>Displacer Beasts may now be encountered in the
    Underdark. (Created by Jaysyn.)</li>
    <li>A limited number of Arrows of Detonation become available in
    SoA.</li>
    <li>Ribald now wears a Robe of the Neutral Archmagi.</li>
    <li>Potion Cases and Ammo Belts are available in SoA.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Additional Shadow Thieves Content</h5>
  <p>
    This component expands on the existing quests focusing around the
    Shadow Thieves. It can be divided into a number of sections:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The player may now side with Mae'Var instead of Renal when
    assigned to infiltrate his guild. In the true spirit of thieves,
    this component allows the player to double-cross his allies time
    after time, although not without consequence. To begin this path,
    the player must take the initiative and tell Mae'Var of Renal's
    mission after gaining his trust.</li>
    <li>There is now a mission to eliminate Aran Linvail and his guild
    on the behalf of Brega in chapter 6. The player will find himself
    fighting his way through the Shadow Thief lair alongside city
    guards. This component will begin automatically in chapter 6 for
    any player who does not have the thief stronghold and has not
    sided with Mae'Var, assuming Aran is still alive; a messenger
    should demand your attention.</li>
    <li>It is now possible to complete Edwin's quests without killing
    Rayic Gethras: you may instead trick Edwin into thinking Rayic is
    dead. New dialogue options should become apparent upon speaking to
    Rayic.</li>
    <li>A quest is introduced centering around the torturer,
    Booter. (Ghrey IM.) If spoken to repeatedly, he will divulge
    information about his victims, and a cunning player may be able to
    utilise some of these details.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To play with this component, a new game should be started,
    or <b>at least</b> a save prior to entering the Shadow Thief
    guild house should be used.
  </p>

  <h5>Alternative Xzar/Harpers Plot</h5>
  <p>
    This component expands the Harper plots in two significant ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>New solutions are introduced to the plot involving Xzar and
    the Harpers. The player may warn the Harpers of Xzar's intentions,
    therefore removing the previous necessity of doing something
    unkind to Jaheira to commence her romance. On the other hand, the
    player is not bound to his word to help the Harpers, and an evil
    player may double-cross them if they so wish. To gain the benefits
    of this component, simply begin Xzar's quest as normal. New dialog
    options should become apparent when speaking with the Harpers in
    the compound.</li>
    <li>Jaheira will now respond to Shazzellim appropriately. There is
    a brief related quest which she should initiate automatically if
    you keep the sword in your possession.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    (Note that this component will also add a eight-hour delay to
    Meronia's spawning after Xzar has been killed. If you're used to
    her appearing instantly, then there's nothing to worry about.)
  </p>

  <h5>Extended Fallen Paladins Material</h5>
  <p>
    Reynald de Chatillon is undeniably an intriguing
    character. Unfortunately, he disappears all too quickly in the
    original game. This component adds additional material after the
    original sequence has finished, expanding on his background,
    beliefs and goals in life.
  </p>
  <p>
    The new Reynald material may be gained even if it is installed
    after the quest has been completed. Simply visiting the Bridge
    District should trigger it. Otherwise, play the quest as normal;
    new dialogue options will soon become apparent.
  </p>

  <h5>Intrigue In The Copper Coronet</h5>
  <p>
    This component makes various enhancements to the Copper Coronet:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A money lender is now available for the player to borrow
    from. Hints around the game should help you locate him. Of course,
    while the player can try to avoid paying back his debts, this is
    not without consequences. And don't expect it to provide an easy
    solution to getting to Spellhold quickly.</li>
    <li>There is a new quest available involving debt repayments in
    the Slums district. To begin this quest, head to the centre of the
    district, where a woman named Moiya should speak with you.</li>
<!--
    <li>Having adjusted the management of the Coronet, it is now
    possible to either remove Surly from the premises, or extort him,
    taking a share of his business profits. Speak to him after killing
    Lehtinan. If you remove Surly from the Coronet, he will attempt to
    set up elsewhere.</li>
-->
  </ul>

  <h5>Rahul Kanakia's Potion Quest</h5>
  <p>
    Originally created by Rahul Kanakia, this little-known gem makes a
    reappearance in Quest Pack. Edited by Ding0 and Compton, Potion
    Quest tells the tale of a man torn between work and family, and of
    the very real consequences of thirst for power.
  </p>
  <p>
    This quest begins in the southwest of the sewers beneath the
    Temple District.
  </p>

  <h5>Revised Hell Trials</h5>
  <p>
    Adahn, original author, writes:
  </p>
  <p>
    Originally intended as a small contribution to a larger project
    that is now never to be completed, this mod deals with the five
    tests that occur in the Abyss (or Gehenna, depending on whom you
    ask) during chapter 7. From a roleplaying standpoint, this final
    stage of the game seemed somewhat unsatisfying, especially for
    neutral characters. And the fact that a neutral protagonist had to
    complete all five tests in the "good" manner in order to remain
    neutral doesn't appear too logical, either.  Therefore, this mod
    attempts to resolve these issues by changing the following
    things:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>For each of the tests there's now a "neutral" path to take,
    resulting in a different reward as well. Sometimes the neutral path is
    closer to the original evil way, sometimes to the good one, and
    sometimes it is completely different to either of them.</li>
    <li>After the last test the protagonist's alignment is judged,
    which can result both in a positive or negative adjustment. It's
    generally easier to drop down to evil than to become good, though.</li>
    <li>The conditions for a paladin's or ranger's loss of his class
    have been slightly refined, causing a higher tolerance of neutral and
    evil acts for the ranger. In addition, specialist clerics will now
    lose their kit if they stray from the alignment dictated by the
    respective god.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Improved Oasis II</h5>
  <p>
    It always seemed that the ToB Oasis was a very limited area,
    designed only for combat. Jamis Tombelthen's dialog was
    insultingly small, and there was only one possible outcome:
    battle. This component expands Jamis Tombelthen's dialog in the
    Oasis area, to potentially allow for a peaceful solution rather
    than inevitable conflict.
  </p>
  <p>
    And, of course, not forgotten is the Combat Enhancement aspect of
    IO2.  This is entirely optional; you may install the Dialogue
    Enhancement with or without the Combat Enhancement. If installed,
    the battle will respond extensively to difficulty setting, party
    size, and party level.
  </p>

  <h5>Saving Sanik In Brynnlaw</h5>
  <p>
    This component adds a window of opportunity during which Sanik can
    be saved from his untimely fate at the hands of Galvena's Assassin
    in Bynnlaw. Be sure to act quickly, however, for the assassin will
    soon penetrate his meagre defence and strike true.
  </p>

  <h5>Burglary Of The Bookkeeper</h5>
  <p>
    One of the most loved (or loathed) characters in all of Amn,
    Galoomp, has been feeling rather down lately. The reason? Somebody
    has been stealing scrolls from his store! Solve the mystery to
    uncover a tale of sadness and rejection in this component
    originally created by Andyr.
  </p>

  <h5>New Fate For The Dryads' Acorns</h5>
  <p>
    Are all dryads the beautiful, innocent creatures they appear to
    be? Originally created by Bons, this component adds an intriguing
    twist to the quest to return Irenicus' dryads' acorns to the
    Windspear Hills. Evil players may delight in the new opportunities
    afforded here, including a delicious gourmet meal. The quest
    begins with a new encounter which will take place in the south of
    the De'Arnise Hold if you have not already returned the acorns.
  </p>

  <h5>The Tragedy Of Besamen</h5>
  <p>
    Originally created by Icelus, this component adds a new encounter
    in the graveyard, in the tomb in which the Staff of Curing may be
    found. A troubled man, stuck somewhere between life and death,
    seeks to be united once more with his true love. Will you bring
    them together, or send them both to rot in their graves?
  </p>

  <h5>Further Slaver Involvement</h5>
  <p>
    This component allows additional options in dealing with the
    slavers around the city:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is now possible to sell the orphan in the Graveyard
    District to Lehtinan. If you know he's a slaver, you can make him
    an offer once you've encountered Risa.</li>
    <li>You may try to extort the slavers, threatening to warn the
    guard if they do not pay up; success is not guaranteed. New
    dialogue options should be apparent in the encounter with the
    slavers and corrupt guards at night in the Slums.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Sending The Solamnic Knights Home</h5>
  <p>
    An option sorely missing from the original game was for non-mage
    characters to send the Solamnic Knights in the Planar Sphere back
    to their home world. Now, any character may do so in exactly the
    same was as was previously the case. New clues have been added to
    account for the lack of Cowled Wizard involvement.
  </p>

  <h5>Nazarial The Lich</h5>
  <p>
    With this component, a new area is added to the Underdark. Deep
    beneath the earth resides an ancient lich, yearning to reach the
    surface and "freedom". Expect a unique and challenging battle with
    an intriguing back story. The new area can be found in the Kua-Toa
    caves west of the main Underdark area; it is somewhat hidden, but
    there may be (rather obvious) clues as to its whereabouts.
  </p>

  <h5>Reward Negotiation</h5>
  <p>
    This component is designed to provide alternative, non-violent
    means of gaining satisfactory rewards in various situations
    throughout the game. Currently only one change is effected:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The player will be able to select specifically what items
    constitute their share of the loot during the division of Vithal's
    spoils from the Underdark portals. (Written by SixOfSpades.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Infernal Thievery</h5>
  <p>
    With this component installed, a new encounter designed by
    SixOfSpades will take place in the Bridge District a few days
    after the skinner murders have been resolved. A man will approach
    you with an unusual offer, and the climax will occur shortly
    afterwards in the southern part of the district.
  </p>

<!--
  <h5>Significance Of The Elven Court Bow</h5>
  <p>
    The changes made by this component are spread thinly over the
    course of the game&mdash;most notable is the introduction of a minor
    new wilderness encounter area. The sequence of events in the new
    story line can be summarised as follows:
    </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The elves may now try to reclaim the Elven Court Bow from
    you. It has been lost too long.</li>
    <li>If you allow them to do so, you may regain it after saving
    Suldanessellar if they deem you worthy.</li>
    <li>It may now be upgraded by Cespenar, making it useful in Throne
    of Bhaal.</li>
  </ul>
-->

  <h4><a id="Section4">Compatibility</a></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The Quest Pack should work fine with most other WeiDU
    mods (including all of those created by the Pocket Plane team). If
    compatibility issues with other WeiDU mods arise, please inform
    me.</li>
    <li>Quest Pack has been tested and confirmed compatible with the
    Big Picture and its associates. Quest Pack's AI and improved
    creatures may safely be installed alongside BP's. Where overlap
    arises, BP's changes will take precedence.</li>
    <li>Quest Pack should function correctly alongside Sword Coast
    Stratagems. Install SCS after Quest Pack, and SCS AI will
    take precedence.</li>
    <li>Iron Modder entries included in this pack should be installed
    prior to Quest Pack (which supersedes the originals), or ideally
    not at all. Any Iron Modder entries included in Quest Pack will be
    automatically removed when they are installed as part of Quest
    Pack.</li>
    <li>The Quest Pack versions of Improved Oasis II, Potion Quest and
    Revised Hell Trials should be installed in favour of the
    standalone versions. If either of the originals are installed, they
    should be removed prior to installation of Quest Pack.</li>
    <li>Quest Pack should be installed AFTER Kelsey and/or Keto to
    allow their interjections to work correctly.</li>
    <li>Quest Pack should be installed AFTER the NPC Flirt Packs to
    prevent flirts activating in the new Underdark area.</li>
    <li>Quest Pack should be installed AFTER Unfinished Business.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><a id="Section5">Section V - FAQs</a></h4>
  <p>
    Aka BIG SPOILERS.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="break"><b>Q:</b> I thought this was meant to be a
    quest pack. What's with all this AI and creature improvement
    nonsense?</span>
    <b>A:</b> While Quest Pack's primary goal is the introduction of
    new adventures to the game, I also feel that portraying foes
    convincingly is essential to maintain the integrity of the
    game. It's hard to tell a compelling story in an environment when
    enemy intelligence is constantly embarrassing. As such, I've made
    some token efforts to lace the entire game with the sort of AI
    found in Quest Pack content, in the hope that it will strengthen
    the story and provide extra fun for players.
  </p>
  <p>
    An excellent illustration of this principle is dragons: with
    metagaming knowledge, we're fully aware that they're something of
    a joke in vanilla BG2, and as such, there's minimal motivation to
    use the Reward Negotiation component with them. However, if
    dragons become credible enemies, there's more sense in a player
    taking the diplomatic route.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's also worth noting that unlike many other mods, "Improved" in
    the Quest Pack context does not exclusively mean "Tougher". While
    many enemies will become more challenging (and respond to the
    difficulty slider), the primary intent of the improvements is to
    make them more believable and fun&mdash;for example, Beholders may now
    lose eyestalks during combat, which is clearly not a change
    intended purely as a difficulty increase.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a more complete AI enhancement package, you might consider
    looking at <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/scs/">Sword Coast
    Stratagems</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break"><b>Q:</b> Where can the money lender be
    found?</span>
    <b>A:</b> In the Copper Coronet, near the door. His name is
    Celile, and you should see him speaking to a boy when you first
    enter. He will not speak with you unless you are very
    persuasive. See if anyone else knows anything about him.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break"><b>Q:</b> I can't seem to side with Mae'Var! He
    just attacks me... what gives?</span>
    <b>A:</b> You can't join him straight away; once you've completed
    Edwin's quests and gained his trust, then try telling him what
    you're up to.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break"><b>Q:</b> I am a problem with Arkanis
    Gath. Can I stop him spawning somehow?</span>
    <b>A:</b> If, for whatever reason, you need to prevent Arkanis
    Gath from showing up, bring up the console and enter:
    <span class="break"><i>SetGlobal("D0DisableArkanis","GLOBAL",1)</i></span>
    Be aware, however, that if you disable Arkanis, it may be possible
    to break the game by killing plot-crucial characters.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break"><b>Q:</b> Where is Moiya's daughter
    taken?</span>
    <b>A:</b> One of the tombs in the graveyard. Try talking to the
    gravedigger and see what you can get out of him.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break"><b>Q:</b> Can Xzar join my party if I save
    him?</span>
    <b>A:</b> No. And in anticipation of the next question, I'm not
    going to be developing a Xzar NPC in the future either. (TDD
    provides a "silent" Xzar NPC, for those determined to acquire
    one.)
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break"><b>Q:</b> Where can Jadarath's family be
    found?</span>
    <b>A:</b> In the southwest of the Bridge District. Try speaking
    with Sidhe and returning to Jadarath, but ensure that you do so
    before bringing him the final potion.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break"><b>Q:</b> How exactly do the changes to the
    Hell Trials work?</span>
    <b>A:</b> The neutral tests are as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="break">WRATH (Sarevok):</span>

    This is only a minor change. It works almost exactly like the good
    path, but instead of refusing the taint because it is evil you can
    do so out of distrust towards Sarevok or because you accept your
    destiny in whichever form it comes.  Reward: +2 intelligence
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break">GREED (Blackrazor):</span>

    Following the good path first you can tell the genie that you
    don't want to kill him, but simply can't give him the sword
    either. He will leave you the sword for as long as you need to
    beat Irenicus and gives you the tear, but places a geas upon you
    to ensure the return of the blade. Later, during the ToB section,
    he will reappear, demanding the sword. Refusing this simply
    results in death.  Reward: +2 THAC0
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break">SELFISHNESS (Sacrifice):</span>

    Now, instead of simply disappearing the demon gives you the chance
    to say what you intend to do. Expressing the willingness to
    sacrifice or to kill the hostage, as well as being unsure has no
    real effect, the test will continue as always. A fourth option
    involves threatening the demon, resulting in a fight. He cannot be
    killed, but after some time surrenders the tear.  Reward: +30%
    resistance to slashing damage
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break">FEAR (Nymph Cloak):</span>

    It is now possible to ask the demon whether the nymphs are dead
    already or whether they still have to be killed (the original
    dialogue has been altered slightly to make this at least remotely
    logical). He will reveal that they are dead already, and you can
    accept the cloak, since refusing it won't change anything.
    Reward: +2 dexterity
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break">PRIDE (Dragon):</span>

    When speaking with the demon, you must follow the evil path
    (saying that you'll kill the creature if it deserves death). The
    dragon (who is now a silver dragon at all times) will initiate
    dialogue, and you can simply talk him out of attacking. As a side
    note, possession of the Human Flesh Armor or the Silver Dragon
    Blood will result in him refusing a peaceful solution.  Reward:
    +30% resistance to magic damage.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break"><b>Q:</b> How is alignment evaluated in
    Revised Hell Trials?</span>
    <b>A:</b> Your alignment is no longer switched to neutral evil
    after a single evil act.  Instead, it will be determined after the
    last test, and can be adjusted to either good, neutral or evil,
    corresponding to the chart below (with e being evil, n being
    neutral and g being good).  With every good test, a counter
    (starting at 3, 4 or 5, depending on your alignment) is raised by
    one, with every evil test it is lowered by this amount.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the left of this table are shown the choices made in the tests
    (good/neutral/evil). On the right is shown the new alignment
    according to the original (good/neutral/evil in that order).
  </p>

  </table>

  <p>
    Obviously, It is generally easier to become evil than good, and
    the chance for an evil character to "ascend" is lower than for a
    good character.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break"><b>Q:</b> My class changed in Revised Hell
    Trials. How come?</span>
    <b>A:</b> Depending on the choices you make, some classes may
    incur penalties with the mod installed. Paladins will lose their
    status after a single evil act or after two neutral ones. A loss of
    rangerhood occurs if your alignment changes, i.e. after three neutral
    or one evil and one neutral act. Specialist priests of Lathander, Helm
    and Talos will lose their kit if they provoke an alignment change in
    either direction. Naturally, this also causes the loss of any special
    powers, such as the "Boon of Lathander" ability. They will not lose
    any normal priest spells, though.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break"><b>Q:</b> What are you smoking? Those
    Demiliches are way too tough now!</span>
    <b>A:</b> If you're finding the randomised targeting too much to
    cope with, then never fear! It's not time to throw Quest Pack away
    just yet. Setting the difficulty slider to Easiest will cause them
    to target only the nearest enemy. (Incidentally, the AI scales up
    from there, so the Demiliches will become smarter with each notch
    of the slider.)
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break"><b>Q:</b> I dispelled the illusion on the
    knights in the Windpear Hills, but they still attack me. How
    come?</span>
    <b>A:</b> While you can see that they're knights, they still think
    you're horrible monsters. They weren't willing to listen to reason
    at first, and they aren't now either.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break"><b>Q:</b> What on earth is the nonsense that
    little girl is spouting?</span>
    <b>A:</b> The cryptic remarks are a nod towards Icewind
    Dale. Hopefully it's at least slightly creepy.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="break"><b>Q:</b> Hi! I installed a load of mods
    including yours and there's something fishy going on which isn't
    mentioned in your readme. Should I visit a gaming forum and blame
    you for it?</span>
    <b>A:</b> The likelihood is that I didn't do it. It's worth
    checking with me, on the off chance that it's a bug/omission, but
    my readmes are typically fairly thorough. I am ideologically
    opposed to mods making undocumented or "secret" changes to the
    game.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Q:</b> I think your writing sucks and I hate you.<br>
    <b>A:</b> That's not a question. However, if you have any feedback
    regarding the content of the mod, please do contact me.  I'd far
    rather be told that you didn't like something than silently lose a
    whole bunch of (prospective) players.

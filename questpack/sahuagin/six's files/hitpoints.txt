Apologies for the one-day delay, here are all the files and examples. Example1.cre is a single-class level 26 mage with 10D4 + 17 hit points (I have used the AD&D tables) with 15 constitution. This should be self-explanatory. Example2.cre is a multi-class level 25 cleric/level 20 mage with 10D6 + 10 + 16 hit points with 16 constitution. The 10D6 hit points come from the average of 10D4 and 9D8 hit points (by rounding), where the hit point bonus is also averaged but may not be less than the amount of level-ups. So for example, the 10 hit point bonus gained by the mage class between levels 10 and 20 remains 10 hit points rather than 5 because you may not get .5 hit points per level up. On the other hand, the bonus hit points gained by the priest class between levels 9 and 26 is 32, so dividing it into one-half will still yield a single hit point for every level up. Example3.cre is a multi-class level 12 fighter, level 12 mage, level 14 thief with 9D7 + 3 + 3 + 2 hit points with 20 constitution. The 9D7 hit points come from the average of 9D10 hit points from the fighter class, 10D4 hit points from the mage class, 10D6 hit points from the thief class. I didn't mess up on the rounding of the number of times the die should be rolled: you *always* round down to get proper results. The number of sides the die have should be rounded to the nearest integer. The first +3 hit points come from one-third of the hit points gained from the fighter class between levels 9 and 12 (the current level), the second +3 hit points come from one-third of the hit points gained from the thief class between levels 10 and 14 (the current level), while the +2 hit points come from the one-third of the hit points gained from the mage class between levels 10 and 12 (the current level). However, because mages gain only 2 hit points over the course of 2 levels, that would mean the mage would recieve .667 hit points for the 2 level-ups, or .33 hit points for a single level-up if I were to split the hit points into one-third as I did with the other 2 classes. So mages are left with 2 hit point bonuses, or 1 hit points for every level up. Example4.cre is a level 4 cleric dualed to a level 14 ranger with 13D9 + 15 hit points with a constitution score of 12. The 13D9 hit points come from 4D8 hit points plus 9D10 hit points. (It is the average of the number of sides the die have and the sum of the number of times the die were rolled). The +15 hit points come from the hit points gained between levels 9 and 14 for the ranger class (it is 3 hp per level, see the AD&D table). Note that if the cleric class were above level 9, don't forget to give the bonus hit points the cleric recieves between the current level and level 9. Because this is a dual-classed character, and the xp isn't divided between various classes, you need not to worry about dividing hit points as you did with multi-classed characters. Because I messed up somewhere, both Example5.cre and Example6.cre are utter crap. Umbhul01.cre (or Umbhul.cre, I forgot the name) is a 8HD+8 umberhulk, recieving 8 hit points in addition to 8D8 hit points. Non-humanoids that should use the D8 roll. Check for the values used in the general.ids rather than race.ids or class.ids. Wolfdisu.cre is a 4HD dire wolf (it is incorrect because in AD&D it should be 4HD+4) with 4D8 hit points. This is self-explanatory. It is important to know that creatures whom you intend to give constitution bonuses (mainly humanoid ones, as monsters don't have constitution scores in AD&D) will have to have their constitution set to 9 as I have done for all the examples except for the dire wolf and the umberhulk (where it doesn't matter for reasons explained above), and then *reset* to their normal values with a spell *after* the hit point rolls/bonuses are applied. Because the timing mode for when those spells are fired off is permanent, use the timing mode delayed, with a delay value of 0. This can most easily explained in an example. A level 13 cleric with 18 constitution would have 2 spells applied to it, giving the hp rolls and hp bonuses, and then a last spell applied to it, resetting it's constitution score to 18. Note that the constitution score is initially set to 9 via patching. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask, because it means I have explained it poorly. -Galactygon

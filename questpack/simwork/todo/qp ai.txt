The first bug is that when such a spellcaster sees a partially visible
    character who is under the effect of Improved Invisibility, his/her global variables are set
    to the wrong numbers as if he/she has already cast his/her spells. The second bug occurs when
    a silenced spellcaster sees an enemy. Again, his/her global variables will be set to wrong
    numbers.



In the original game, Clay and Stone golems would cast their Haste and Slow spells even
    during time stop. The same bug existed for Vortext Spiders casting their Voretx Web spells.
    The bug is fixed.



Vampyre creature in the old crypt (Korgan's book plot) would stand at his place doing nothing
    if the party were not in his line of sight (he would not move to appraoch the party). His
    script is revised and he will move forward as soon as he is spawned. He is also tweaked to be
    able to see invisible creatures.

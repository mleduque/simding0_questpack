xmas todo:
- return to chateau irenicus
- blood war on carceri
- 6oS's elves stuff
- some teleport plot that takes you back to a BG1 area with familiar characters?
- blades of brynnlaw!


fix trolls
6oS sahuagin


AI ideas:
- irenicus uses bhaalspawn powers?
- what do vampires, liches and demiliches (all greater undead) do against pro-undead/negative plane protection?  (cast remove magic if they take damage from an unseen opponent)
- liches - do something about slow movement? more in the way of minions?


AI casts dispel magic on sanctuaried creatures


Improved invisibility checks to avoid bug Sikret found.


greater otyugh - insect plague on death? (stolen from tactics) disease?
carrion crawlers - disease?



problem with my mind flayers: Project Force can knock people through closed doors--which is especially awkward when Minsc has been buffeted into the Githyankis' locked cell and you have no legal way of getting him out.


bodhi should avoid killing player in chapter 3 unless she has nothing else to do--try to incapacitate him, reduce him to really low HPs, etc, then go after and kill other party members


bodhi's lair has dominated human allies: "Charmed Fodder"



what's with the golem cloudkills? more appropriate ability?



Have select bands of creatures use my patrolling scripting.



Copy/paste errors in demilich AI (give Demiliches some new abilities or ways of getting round Spell Immunity and Protection from Undead?)

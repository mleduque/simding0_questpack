I visualise Rayic as gruff, middle-aged and upper class. I also portray the conflict between him and Edwin more as a personal vendetta rather than a long-standing matter of the Cowled Wizards'.


~Hold!  How dare you intrude on my studies!~

~Ah, you have dispatched the servants which stop every other common beggar from looting my house?  Then I shall have to punish you myself for your insolence!~

~Out, then!  Out you go or you shall suffer the wrath of my great magic!~

~As if I am informed of every deviant waif brought in.  Bah!  I'll not suffer such insolence!~

~Bah!  I'll not suffer such insolence!~

~You were warned!  Now I, Rayic Gethras, shall deal with you as the ignorant peasant that you are!~

~Ah, Edwin, how nice of you to join us.  Surprised to see me?~

~Bah!  Idiots, all of you!  Feel my wrath!~

~Edwin?  What is going on here?!~

~Edwin?  What is going on here?!  You will suffer my wrath for this intrusion!~

~I see Edwin is not with you.  My patience is running thin.~

~Then be quick about it.  This disturbance is already beginning to irritate me.~

~A pity, I would have liked to deal with Edwin.  But no matter, I shall return to my studies.  Out!~


(Since there are a lot of very similar lines, I can probably just do a cut/paste job on some of them. Or cut down on what's voiced. It's fairly gratuitous-- I just think the lines are ones that'd be fun to hear spoken.)

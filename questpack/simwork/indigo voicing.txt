"I imagine you are wary of strangers, as well you should be; but I assure you, I am no foe. I have made my own way through the darkness, much as you did. However, if you are willing, I have a tale to tell."

"Your life stretches long before you; make the most of your freedom, lest you chance to lose it."

"You have heard my tale, and perhaps now you see something in what I have told. Your life stretches long before you; make the most of your freedom, lest you chance to lose it."
